# Clash of Clans Attack Simulator

Written in [Clojurescript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) using [pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) to render.

The latest working version can be found at http://jmmk.github.io/clash-attack-sim/

**Very much a Work In Progress**

#### Credits
Most of the Entity-Component-System functions were borrowed from [asteroids](https://github.com/johntrimble/asteroids) and a lot of good ideas were gleaned from [chocolatier](https://github.com/alexkehayias/chocolatier) and [enoki](https://github.com/harto/enoki).

Also, I learned a lot about Entity-Component-System architecture from [Richard Lord's blog](http://www.richardlord.net/).
